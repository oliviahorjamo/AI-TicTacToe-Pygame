* You can insert your move by clicking the wanted square. After you have clicked the square, the ai will make its move. After ai has made its move, it is your turn and so on.

* The program will show whose turn it is in the left bottom corner.
* When a win has been achieved either by you or the ai, the game ends. The screen will inform which one has won.
