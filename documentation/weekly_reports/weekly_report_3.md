# Week 3

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 3

* Coding the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning.
* Trying to solve why row and columns are wrong way in the game board.
* Trying to solve how to make the winning check better
* Testing the code.

A lot of my time went to trying to fix the code and finding solutions to make the winning check better. I was quite a stuck in finding better solutions, so I did not succeed to go forward in the project as much as I would have wanted to.

## Problems

Problem 1. I have not figured out how to fix the rows and columns the right way.
Problem 2. The algorithm will put its move to (0, 0) although I have put a requirement that it cannot enter a move somewhere where is already an X or O.

## Questions

I need help to solve the problems above.

## Next week

Next week I will fix the errors and if time, I will continue to make the algorithm more efficient. I will also try to figure out how to make the winning checks better if I manage to fix the problems above.
