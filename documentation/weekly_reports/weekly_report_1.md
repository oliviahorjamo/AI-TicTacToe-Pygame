# Week 1

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 1

In this week, I have concentrated on the following topics:

* Project creation and setting up the repository in GitHub.
* Studying minimax algorith and alpha beta purning.
* Created structure for the project.
* Coding basic of TicTacToe.
* Writing documentation.

At this point, I have everything set-up for the project and I think that the project has progressed very well. 


## Problems

I had little problems creating a game grid form tuple dictionary and that took more time that I assumed. Eventually, I got it working. 

## Questions

I dont have any questions at this point. I talked with the course assistant and got good ideas for the project.


## Next week

Next week, my target is to do a lot of coding and start testing the code.
