# Week 2

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 2

This week went quite well and I think I am ahead of my schedule.

I did the following things:

* Coded basics of the game (including pygame features).
* Testing of Game and GameBoard classes.
* Docstring

## Problems

I had problems creating the cross and circle at the right locations, but I eventually got them in the right locations.

## Questions

No questions at the moment.

## Next week

Now when I have coded basics of the game, I will start to do the minimax algorithm next week.
