[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 4

This week I had to spend a lot of time figuring out why the algorithm is not placing the 'O' in right places. That is why the entire week I did debugging and making changes to the code.

* I debugged the game board.
* I changed and debugged the minimax algorithm.
* I debugged the ui.

Now the minimax algorithm is working better.

## Problems

Well I had quite a lot of problems this week, but not anymore.

## Questions

Can I have some references/web pages where to look how to make the minimax algorithm more efficient so that i

## Next week

I will start making the algorithm more efficient.
