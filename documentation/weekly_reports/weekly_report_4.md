# Week 4

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 4

This week I had to spend a lot of time figuring out why the algorithm is not placing the 'O' in right places. That is why the entire week I did debugging the code and making changes to the code that I had already done.

* I debugged the game board.
* I changed and debugged the minimax algorithm.
* I debugged the ui.

## Problems

Well I had quite a lot of problems.

## Questions

No questions at this point.

## Next week

I will start making the algorithm better.
