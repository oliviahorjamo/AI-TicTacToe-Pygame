# Week 4

[Hour reporting](https://github.com/riikkayoki/TicTacToe/blob/master/documentation/hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 4

This week I had to spend a lot of time figuring out why the algorithm is not placing the 'O' in right places. That is why the entire week I did debugging and making changes to the code. The project did not go so much further, but I believe that after 35 hours of debugging the program I am quite aware of things and I can move forward now.

* I debugged the game board.
* I changed and debugged the minimax algorithm.
* I debugged the ui.
* I debugged the entire code.

Now the minimax algorithm is working better.

## Problems

I had quite a lot of problems this week. I used many hours figuring why the algorithm was not working.

## Questions

No questions at this point

## Next week

I will need to plan a new code for checking win for the board. I will start making the algorithm more efficient and modify the algorithm.
